# SpriteStitcher

A quick 'n dirty winforms app for stitching together a spritesheet from individual images

## Use

Using SpriteStitcher is as straightforward as possible:

1. ![Download the binary](https://github.com/DeadlyBrad42/SpriteStitcher/releases/tag/v1.0). (Or compile it from the source!)
1. Enter the number of sprite rows and columns the final spritesheet will have.
1. Hit "Choose Sprites" and select the sprites you want.
1. Check the preview box to make sure everything looks okay! Then just hit "Save Output"
