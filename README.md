# SpriteStitcher

A quick 'n dirty winforms app for stitching together a spritesheet from individual images. Now with additoinal RPG Maker usefulness!

## Use

Using SpriteStitcher is as straightforward as possible:

1. ![Download the binary](https://github.com/MechanicalPen/RPGSpriteStitcher/releases/tag/v1.2). (Or compile it from the source!)
1. Enter the number of sprite rows and columns the final spritesheet will have (usually 4 rows and 3 columns unless its RPG Maker XP, then use 4 rows and 4 columns).
1. Hit "Choose Sprites" and select the sprites you want.
1. Check the preview box to make sure everything looks okay!
1. Notice things don't look okay and drag the frames into their proper spot.
1. Then just hit "Save Output"
